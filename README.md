### Installing the bot
Download the repository. Once downloaded, head to the config.js file. Follow the instructions there to add your configuration data. Once done, open a terminal in the directory and run `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies. 

### Adding the bot to your server
Head to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. Once done, head to the 'Bot' tab and click 'Add Bot'. Once done, make a new file in the main folder and name it `.env`. Copy your bot's token. Inside the .env file, write "token=your_discord_token_goes_here", replacing your_discord_token_goes_here with your bot's token which you had copied moments earlier.

You can use the above lik to add your bot to your server. Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID with your bot's client ID. You can find this in the 'General Information' tab of your application in the Discord Developer Portal.

Once done, run `node index.js` to start the bot. You can do this by either clicking and running 'start.bat', or by holding shift+right clicking in the folder and then clicking 'Open PowerShell window here' and then typing `node index.js` to start the process. If you have not installed your dependencies, then the bot will not start. You can install your dependencies by running the command `npm install` in the terminal.
